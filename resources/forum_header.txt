Welcome to your Critique House for the month! This is a great chance for you to learn not only what readers and other writers may think about your story, but to figure out what does and doesn’t work for you in others’ stories. Critique has been very powerful for a lot of authors in COTEH, and we hope it will be for you, too. To help you out, here’s COTEH’s philosophy and how groups usually go, logistically speaking. 

**COTEH's Philosophy of Craft**
- On COTEH, we approach storytelling as a process of engaging with the reader's expectations to make sure our stories land the way they're supposed to.
- A key skill in this approach is understanding reader reactions and how the things we've written trigger those reactions.
- In critique groups, you train that skill by 1) identifying and articulating your own reactions to other stories, and 2) using reader reactions to your story to diagnose what needs to change in order to have the effect you want.

**Crit Group Logistics**
- Groups have 2-4 members and meet for 4 weeks. (If you're vibing with your group, you can request to stay together when you sign up next month.)
- Each week, everyone submits one chapter (or equivalent) for feedback, then gives feedback on everyone else's submissions.
- We have a reminder bot that posts every Monday, but it's up to your group to organize and set deadlines.
- Communicate with your group. Life happens. Things don't go according to plan. Let people know what's going on so they can plan accordingly.,

Additionally, we have a voice channel if your group would like to discuss things ‘in person.’
